## sql-injection-attack-example/perl-backdoor.pl
This code appears to be intended to create a reverse shell connection that provides the attacker with access to the target system. As such, it is a potential security threat and should be examined further.

## sql-injection-attack-example/README.md
This code appears to contain a potential SQL injection attack, as well as commands to allow for a malicious user to gain shell access to the webserver with PHP and Python backdoors. In order to secure the codebase, any input from a user should be sanitized before being entered into the database. Additionally, the backdoors should be removed and proper authentication should be enforced for any users accessing the site.

## sql-injection-attack-example/Vagrantfile

## sql-injection-attack-example/dump/user.sql

## sql-injection-attack-example/dump/contact.sql
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/functions.php
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/step5.php
This code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of an unsafe query with user input both in the query statement itself and in the MD5 encryption. This allows an attacker to execute malicious code with the input, such as modifying the database or running system commands. Furthermore, the JavaScript code that is included in the HTML is vulnerable to XSS attacks as user input is being used in the script without proper sanitation.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/step4.php
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/step3.php
Unfortunately, this code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The code is not validating user input before it is being passed into the SQL query, which is a significant security risk. Without proper sanitization and validation, an attacker could potentially maliciously alter the query to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or data.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/step2.php
This code appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The code is using plain text for the username and a non-salted MD5 hash for the password, as well as using user provided input directly in the SQL query without sanitizing it first. An attacker could use this vulnerability to access any user's account by manipulating the query in the request. To secure this code, you would need to sanitize user provided data before using it in a query, use a stronger hashing algorithm for the password, and salt the password when hashing it for storage.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/index.php
There is a potential threat of SQL injection in this code, particularly with the "SQL Injection Playground" link, as well as the "Login" and "SQL injection steps" links. It is not a good practice to have these links in their current form. If the code developer is not considering security best practices, the system may be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Additionally, the code requires access to potentially sensitive system information, such as the HTTP host, server IP address, and operating system version. This could present a security risk if access to the code is not carefully monitored.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/step1.php
This code is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The user input is not validated or escaped prior to being included in the SQL query, allowing for malicious input to be included. This could allow an attacker to access and modify data in the database. To mitigate, the input should be validated and escaped prior to being included in the SQL query.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/sql-injection-playground.php
This code contains a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the SQL statement that is generated from the form input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the query and possibly take unauthorized actions. Specifically, an attacker could modify the statement to include additional commands and execute them in the database. For example, an attacker could modify the statement to update the last name of all users. To fix the issue, the code should use prepared statements with parameterized queries to ensure that the query cannot be modified.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/config.php
Unfortunately, this code does not appear to be secure. The "HOST" constant is set to "insecure.local", which implies that the connection is not secure. Additionally, the credentials for the PDO object are all stored in plain text, which is a potential security risk. As such, the code is not safe, and must be improved in order to be secure.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/contact-list.php
This code is vulnerable to SQL injection. As written, the code takes the input from a GET request and directly puts it into a query string without any validation or sanitisation. This allows for malicious user input, such as in the example given in the code. To prevent this, input should be sanitised and/ or validated against a known set of inputs.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/css/style.css
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/images/.gitignore
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/scripts/reverse-shell.py
This code appears to be trying to establish a remote connection to a server at IP address 10.0.2.2, on port 4444. Depending on the system's firewall settings, this may be a backdoor attempt. It could be attempting to execute shell commands from the remote server, possibly with malicious intentions. Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine the true purpose of this code.

## sql-injection-attack-example/web/scripts/reverse-shell.sh
This code is not safe! It attempts to redirect a shell to a UDP port on localhost, which is a typical technique used by attackers to gain access to a system.

## sql-injection-attack-example/provisioners/ansible_hosts
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/provisioners/playbook.yml
Unfortunately, this code snippet is incomplete. Without knowing the contents of the roles, it's impossible to analyze it for potential threats. Therefore, I cannot give an opinion as to whether it is safe or not.

## sql-injection-attack-example/provisioners/roles/database/vars/local_dev.yml
There is a potential security threat in this code. The root_password provides too much access to the developer, allowing the developer to make changes to the system with root privileges. This can be a security hazard as it can allow for malicious activity to go unnoticed. To fix this issue, the root_password should be removed from the code and instead stored in an environment-specific configuration file.  Additionally, it is recommended to use stronger passwords for the username, password and database.

## sql-injection-attack-example/provisioners/roles/database/tasks/main.yml
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/provisioners/roles/database/templates/my.cnf.j2
It appears that the code is attempting to set a root user with an unencrypted password. This is a potential security threat as it could leak the password if the codebase is not secure. It is recommended that the root user be protected by another form of secure authentication like two-factor authentication.

## sql-injection-attack-example/dev/ssh-import-database.sh
It is difficult to say definitively whether or not this code is safe without knowing what the import-database.sh script does and without knowing the content of the .my.cnf file. However, if both files are configured securely and the script is only used to securely import a database, this code could be considered safe. That said, it is always recommended to audit any code for potential security issues before executing it.

## sql-injection-attack-example/dev/provision.sh
SAFE!

## sql-injection-attack-example/dev/import-database.sh
Although this code appears to be safe, there are still some potential threats that must be noted. First, the code is running as root, which may be a potential security risk if the code is not properly sanitized and validated. Additionally, the code relies on a dump from the www directory, which could potentially be vulnerable to malicious scripts if not handled properly. Finally, it is possible for malicious code to be injected into the MySQL database if stronger authentication measures are not taken.
